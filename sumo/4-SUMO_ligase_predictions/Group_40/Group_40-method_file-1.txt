We used SAVER (Single Amino acid Variant EvaluatoR) algorithm to assess the effect of substitutions on the protein function (manuscript under review). SAVER algorithm doesn’t depend on a machine learning technique and it is free of data training. The inputs of the algorithm are multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree, and orthologous/paralogous information. Similar protein sequences were retrieved using BLASTP. The sequences were align using MAFFT E-INS-I algorithm. The phylogenetic tree was build using the Phyml package. The node of the most recent major duplication was isolated from the tree and the rest of the analysis was performed using only that clade, which likely includes SUMO ligase orthologs and nothing else. In the subtree we generated, we identified two sets: (i) Recent proteins (Gnathostomata clade) and (ii) all orthologs. We eliminated the paralogous sequences within these sets. The SAVER algorithm uses purely evolutionary history of a position (no structural information was used). Simply, if a position is highly conserved a substitution is not favored. If a given substitution is observed throughout the evolutionary history of a protein, the substitution is favored depending on how many times that particular substitution occurred. If a particular substitution is not observed for the position that is not conserved, the substitution is still favored by the algorithm based on the tendency of the original position to be changed into a non-favorable amino acids based on the BLOSUM62 matrix.
The full details of the algorithm will be released after the manuscript is published.
