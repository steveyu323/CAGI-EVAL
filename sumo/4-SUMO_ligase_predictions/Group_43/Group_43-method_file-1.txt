The impact of missense mutations was estimated using the Evolutionary Action (EA) method (Katsonis P and Lichtarge O, Genome Res, 2014) for the protein sequence with the P63279 UniProt ID that corresponds to the UBE2I gene. The EA scores were treated as the percent of loss or gain of function of a single mutant when the wild-type amino acid appeared more or less frequently than the substitute in the protein family sequence alignment, respectively. For alleles with multiple mutations, we combined the estimated loss/gain of function by simply multiplying the predicted function of the individual mutants. The standard deviation was arbitrarily se to 0.1 for all alleles.
